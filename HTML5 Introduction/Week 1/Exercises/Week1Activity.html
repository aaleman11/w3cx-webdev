        <p>We sent out the SOS call.<br>
            It was a quarter past four in the morning when the storm broke our second anchor line.<br>
            Four months at sea, four months of calm seas to be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point.<br>
            They call them rogues, they travel fast and alone.<br>
            One-hundred-foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong.<br>
            What they call love is a risk, cause you will always get hit out of nowhere by some wave and end up on your own.<br>
            The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts to bail us out.<br>
            And flooded the engines and radio and half buried bow.<br>
            Your tongue is a rudder.<br>
            It steers the whole ship.<br>
            Sends your words past your lips or keeps them safe behind your teeth.<br>
            But the wrong words will strand you.<br>
            Come off course while you sleep.<br>
            Sweep your boat out to sea or dashed to bits on the reef.<br>
            The vessel groans the ocean pressures its frame.<br>
            To the port I see the lighthouse through the sleet and rain.<br>
            And I wish for one more day to give my love and repay debts.<br>
            But the morning finds our bodies washed up thirty miles west.<br>
            They say that the captain stays fast with the ship through still and storm.<br>
            But this ain't the Dakota, and the water is cold.<br>
            We won't have to fight for long.<br>
            This is the end.<br>
            This story's old but it goes on and on until we disappear.<br>
            Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed while you were underneath.<br>
            I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains sunk below the sea.<br>
            I spoke the words but never gave a thought to what they all could mean.<br>
            I know that this is what you want.<br>
            A funeral keeps both of us apart.<br>
            You know that you are not alone.<br>
            Need you like water in my lungs.<br>
            This is the end. <br>
